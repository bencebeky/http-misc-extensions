    "body": "Previously we've considered two validation rules: \"require the certificate to validate for the SNI\" or \"don't require the certificate to validate for the SNI\".  The former prevents us from setting the SNI to an unrelated domain, but the latter allows an active adversary to observe the CERTIFICATE_REQUEST frame and learn the true destination.\r\n\r\nThis change splits the difference, making the rule \"require the certificate to validate for the SNI or for the origin\".  This implicitly relies on TLS 1.3 to hide the origin's certificate if the SNI is an unrelated domain.",
